#Simulation Rendering and Visualization Library

This library simplifies the process of converting simulation data into high-quality 2D images. It supports a variety of simulation packages and employs advanced rendering techniques to enhance the precision and clarity of visualizations.
#Key Features:

  Super-cell Generation: Extends the simulation system into larger periodic structures, enabling analysis across broader spatial scales.
  Atomic Property Assignment: Accurately defines atomic properties such as radii and color, distinguishing atom types and interactions.
  Bond Detection: Identifies and highlights chemical bonds, providing insights into molecular structures and connectivity.

By using these techniques, the library produces detailed and high-resolution visual representations of complex molecular and atomic structures, improving the interpretability of simulation results.

#Requirements

  Python (>= 3.7, but should work with any 3.x version)
  Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE >= 3.15, but should work with other versions)
