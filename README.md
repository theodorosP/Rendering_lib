Simulation Rendering and Visualization Library

This library simplifies the process of converting simulation data into high-quality, 2D images. It supports a variety of simulation packages and employs advanced rendering techniques to enhance the precision and clarity of visualizations.
Key Features:

  Super-cell Generation: Extends the simulation system into larger periodic structures, enabling analysis across broader spatial scales.
  Atomic Property Assignment: Accurately defines atomic properties such as radii and color, distinguishing atom types and interactions.
  Bond Detection: Identifies and highlights chemical bonds, providing insights into molecular structures and connectivity.

By using these techniques, the library produces detailed and high-resolution visual representations of complex molecular and atomic structures, improving the interpretability of simulation results.

This tool is ideal for researchers and developers seeking to transform 3D simulation data into clear, accessible 2D images.
